## Hello,                                                                                                               ##
## I am the Scandinavian, the creator of this script.                                                                   ##
## Chances are you haven't heard of me until now.                                                                       ##
## The script the work of an amateur with a slightly-more-than-passing interest in the Warhammer 40,000 setting.        ##
##                                                                                                                      ##
## The creation table I worked off of was originally made by the anons on 4chan's /tg/.                                 ##
## If you're curious, it can be found on 1d4chan.org.                                                                   ##
## I have never personally visited /tg/, unless after the time of writing this I shared this script there.              ##
## If anyone from /tg/ reads this, thanks for the inspiraton guys.                                                      ##
## I manually rolled 52 Chapters on the table before I got the idea to automate the process.                            ##
##                                                                                                                      ##
## Most of the sources I've used for the roll results are from 1d4chan, Lexicanum, or the Warhammer 40k Wiki.           ##
## Perhaps unsurprisingly, cross-referencing was a mess. I can now sympathize with the Adeptus Administratum.           ##
##                                                                                                                      ##
## Prior to writing this, I had very little coding experience, and none at all in Python.                               ##
## With that in mind, please be aware that the script is not at all perfect, but it does work.                          ##
## It will allow you to automatically generate a Space Marine Chapter in the form of a text document.                   ##
## (Names are not generated, you'll have to do that part.)                                                              ##
##                                                                                                                      ##
## The script's only requirement is that Python is installed.                                                           ##
## Without Python installed, the script will not work.                                                                  ##
##                                                                                                                      ##
## The text file generated by the script will be put in the same folder as the script itself.                           ##
## It will be called "Your Chapter.txt" - I recommend that you store the script in its own folder.                      ##
##                                                                                                                      ##
## VERY IMPORTANT:                                                                                                      ##
##                                                                                                                      ##
## BE AWARE THAT RUNNING THE SCRIPT TWICE DOES NOT CREATE 2 TEXT FILES.                                                 ##
## THE 2ND TEXT FILE WILL OVERRIDE THE 1ST.                                                                             ##
## IF YOU WANT TO KEEP THE TEXT FILE, YOU SHOULD RENAME IT OR MOVE IT.                                                  ##
##                                                                                                                      ##
## The script is easily modifiable.                                                                                     ##
## Simply alter the generated text (the green codelines in the f.writelines("") sections).                              ##
## Be aware that \n is a function that writes text on a new line. Without it, the text output would all be on one line. ##
##                                                                                                                      ##
## The code should be fairly easy to read.                                                                              ##
## To a seasoned coder, I'm sure many parts of it appear crude or inefficient, but I tried to at least make it legible. ##
##                                                                                                                      ##

##                                                                                                                      ##
## To clarify: a script is not an app.                                                                                  ##
## A script is a non-compiled sequence of instructions or commands for a computer to execute. I have, in effect,        ##
## created a document which a computer can read and interpret to perform an action. This particular script instructs a  ##
## computer on opening a .txt file, what to name it, what to write in it, how to format it and how to save it.          ##
## It is code that acts upon some system in an external or independent manner and can be removed or disabled without    ##
## disabling the system itself.                                                                                         ##
## An app, or a program, is code that constitutes a system. The program's code may be written in a modular manner, with ##
## good separation of concerns, but the code is fundamentally internal to, and a dependency of, the system itself.      ##
##                                                                                                                      ##
## There are other distinctions between a script and an app, but further elaboration is unnecessary here.               ##
## This script, being a script and not an app, to the best of my knowledge, does not break the intellectual property    ##
## guidelines as laid out by Games Workshop here: https://www.games-workshop.com/en-US/Intellectual-Property-Guidelines ##
##                                                                                                                      ##
## Oh, and it's open source.                                                                                            ##
##                                                                                                                      ##
## In closing, I have no idea how many people will ever use my script, let alone take the time to read all this.        ##
## If you find this message, I appreciate you.                                                                          ##
## And, if you so desire, do share my script with your friends.                                                         ##
