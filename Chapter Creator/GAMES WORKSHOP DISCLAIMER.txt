To clarify: a script is not an app.
A script is a non-compiled sequence of instructions or commands for a computer to execute. I have, in effect, created a document which a computer can read and interpret to perform an action. This particular script instructs a computer on opening a .txt file, what to name it, what to write in it, how to format it and how to save it.
It is code that acts upon some system in an external or independent manner and can be removed or disabled without disabling the system itself.                                                                         
An app, or a program, is code that constitutes a system. The program's code may be written in a modular manner, with good separation of concerns, but the code is fundamentally internal to, and a dependency of, the system itself.

There are other distinctions between a script and an app, but further elaboration is unnecessary here. 
This script, being a script and not an app, to the best of my knowledge, does not break the intellectual property guidelines as laid out by Games Workshop here: https://www.games-workshop.com/en-US/Intellectual-Property-Guidelines
